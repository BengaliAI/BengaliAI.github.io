 To expedite Bengali language recognition research, Bengali.AI initiated a Massively Crowdsourced multi-university reserach intiative to collect 2000+ hours of
    annotated Bengali speech data. The MaCro Dataset contains samples representative of different accents, dialects and acoustic background situations. The dataset and the
    benchmark codes are publicly available for reearch. We have now launching a Kaggle featured competition on this dataset to further expedite research!!</center>

      <p>We present OOD-Speech, the first out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarking dataset for Bengali automatic
speech recognition (ASR). Being one of the most spo-
ken languages globally, Bengali portrays large diversity
in dialects and prosodic features, which demands ASR
frameworks to be robust towards distribution shifts. For
example, islamic religious sermons in Bengali are deliv-
ered with a tonality that is significantly different from
regular speech. Our training dataset is collected via mas-
sively online crowdsourcing campaigns which resulted in
1177.94 hours collected and curated from 22, 645 native
Bengali speakers from South Asia. Our test dataset com-
prises 23.03 hours of speech collected and manually anno-
tated from 17 different sources, e.g., Bengali TV drama,
Audiobook, Talk show, Online class, and Islamic sermons
to name a few. OOD-Speech is jointly the largest pub-
licly available speech dataset, as well as the first out-of-
distribution ASR benchmarking dataset for Bengali.</p>
